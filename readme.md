**Pantoum**
============

Pantoum is a web-based personal blogging service that utilizes web technologies from both client and server sides. It opens a platform for authenticated users to create, edit, and maintain their blogging articles. As one might suggest, writing is the closest form to time-travel we have for human-beings.

For system requirements and installation guides, please head over to the project's [wiki](https://github.com/tachymetre/pantoum/wiki)
